# MEAM5100 - Design of Mechatronic Systems (Fall 2024)

Repository containing final project code for MEAM5100: Design of Mechatronic Systems, taken during Fall 2024. Project collaborators are Cole Nagata, Pyo Lim, and Solomon Gonzalez.

**Instructors:** Mark Yim and Jessica Weakly<br/>

**Class Description:**<br/>
In many modern systems, mechanical elements are tightly coupled with electronic components and embedded computers. Mechatronics is the study of how these domains are interconnected. This hands-on, project-based course teaches: **mechanical** elements -prototyping (lasercutting, 3D printing), microcontrollers (ATmega32-U4, ESP32), actuators (DC motors, servos, solenoids, LEDS) and sensor (light, sound, touch, force sensors), **electronics** - basic circuits, filters, op amps, discrete logic, sensing and control of voltage and current, and **computing** - interfacing with the analog world, microprocessor technology, basic control theory, wireless communication and structured embedded programming (including register level) and some web programming.

**Project Description:**<br/>
Forthcoming.
